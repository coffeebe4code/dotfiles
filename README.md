# About
The DISC language is a lisp dialect based language. This project has a goals that will ensure success and adoption of the language. The goals are...

- **Tooling is first class**. The language server, the cli, the parser, everything for a developer to be successful will all be included in decisions and apart of the main project.
- **Make the fastest interpreted language available**. Tools will be able to output optimal performance suggestions for the interpreted scripts.
- **Provide the best embedded support**. Embedded systems require demanding performance use of their hardware. Supporting embedded systems will force the tooling we make to be as efficient as possible, thus further helping the second goal.
- **Documentation is key**. Making documentation a number one priority will ensure that any new people to the project

- **D**ynamically (typed)
- **I**nterpreted and
- **S**trongly (typed) 
- **C**ompiled language.

That's right. We can't forgo the success of interpreted languages like javascript and python. They just run and you get instant feedback about where in the program a problem occurs.

But, we also can't forgo the safety our programs get in strongly typed systems
